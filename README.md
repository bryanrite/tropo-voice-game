# Tropo Voice Enabled Game

A simple, proof of concept, voice enabled game utilizing Tropo's WebAPI.

**Please Note:** This application uses jQuery to poll for new actions to keep the application self-contained and simple. In reality, you would want to utilize a queing mechanism and potentially a sub/pub interface like BOSH or WebSockets to keep the UI updated properly.  This would alleviate synchronization issues you might find in this proof of concept.
